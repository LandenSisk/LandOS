• LandOS changes background color, color can be changed
  by changing the value in bl. Tested values:
  - 0x01: Blue
  - 0x02: Green
  - 0x03: Sky Blue
  - 0x04: Red
  - 0x05: Pink
  - 0x06: Yellow
  - 0x07: Gray
  - 0x08: Dark Green
  - 0x09: Cobalt Blue
• New function that changes background color
• Fixed bug causing OS to print random characters
• WIP: Began working on a function to draw a new screen

7/10/2022:
• Finshed "newscreen" function
• Utilized "newscreen" function to clear ugly text after boot
• Set *X register to 0x00 if both *l and *h register's value was 0x00
• "keytocont" is now "to_main"
• Moved around some strings

7/11/2022:
• Added a safe return place ("main") for the OS to return to when finished with a program
• "to_main" brings you to "main"
• Changed a few calls to jumps
• OS is currently an infinite loop of jumping to "main" after key input

7/12/2022:
• LandOS's main screen now only responds to the follow scan codes:
  - 72 (Up key)
  - 80 (Down key)
  - 28 (Enter)
• After recieving one of the following keys you are sent to "to_main" where the os responds to any scan code

7/20/2022:
• Created "BaseFeatures" directory which will hold everything we need for the kernel
• Multiple files were created to sort the code so you dont want to rip your teeth out looking for a specific function

7/27/2022:
• Created "drivers.asm" and "pixel.asm" files
• Created function called 'switch_vmode' to check current video mode and switch the video mode
  -  If video mode is 0x03 (Text, 80x25, 16fore/8back color) switch video mode to 0x10
  -  If video mode is 0x10 (Graphics, 640x350, 16 color) switch video mode to 0x03
• Created function called 'write_pixel' to write a singular pixel to the screen
• Created function called 'loop_write_pixel' to make a diagnal blue line out of pixels
• After pressing any key the OS utilizes the 'loop_write_pixel'

7/31/2022:
• OS now has small delay when drawing each pixel
